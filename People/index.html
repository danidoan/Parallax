            <h2>Vietnamese People</h2>
            <p>
                The origins of the Vietnamese people are a combination of the Mongol races of north and east Asia, with Chinese and Indian influences.
            </p>
            <p>
                The population is surpassed only by Indonesia as Southeast Asia's most heavily populated country. However, Vietnam is the region's most ethnically homogenous country with the Vietnamese making up about 90% of the population.
            </p>
            <p>
                85% of Vietnam's ethnic-minority population belongs to indigenous groups - the largest of which are Thai and Hmong - who have been settled in the mountainous regions of the country for many centuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                About 3% of the population is ethnic Chinese living in the urban centres of the South.
